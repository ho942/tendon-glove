fingerMCP

- horizontalInput = SerialHandler.instance.GetHorizontalInput(); : Receive joystick value sent by SerialHandler
- Basic finger range adjustment

fingerPIP, fingerDIP :

- horizontalInput = SerialHandler.instance.GetHorizontalInput(); : Receive joystick value sent by SerialHandler
- Adjust the basic finger range to move only 80 to 0 based on the angle of the finger MCP

SerialHandler

- Get Joystick Arduino Price
- Grab value that bounces from Arduino value (for joysticks)
- OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) :
-   1) Send a signal to Arduino in case of contact
-     SendSignals: Send a Great Climate Signal
-     SendSignal (string signal): Code that sends signals entering signal to Arduino.
-   2) To prevent any further catching during contact (coded by hand because the rigid was not set)
-     If the if horizontalInput is positive at the time of contact, insert the horizontalInput of the SerialHandler and make it 0.

<Arduino>
- Serial.print:sending serial communication
- analogRead: Read signal from joystick
- Map: Take the signal separately from -500 to 500
- myServo.writeMicroseconds (500):Motor running
- data = Serial.read(): Read values entered into serial communication
